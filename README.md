# wms-ssi-prototype

Here is where will be open-sourcing our libaries, Grant for the Web coming soon!
In the meantime, we are hard at work at our private
[gitlab](https://gitlab.com/sourcecheck), request permissions there if you are
curious about the project and can't wait that long!

For now, see our [architecture document](architecture.md).  The components are:
* [Publisher front-end](/SourceCheckOrg/wms-ssi-ui/)
* [Publisher backend API](/SourceCheckOrg/wms-ssi-api/)
* [Publisher backend dB](/SourceCheckOrg/wms-ssi-db/)
* [Reader PDF-reader](/SourceCheckOrg/wms-ssi-preview/)
