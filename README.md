# wms-ssi-prototype

Here is where will be open-sourcing our libaries, Grant for the Web coming soon!
In the meantime, we are hard at work at our private
[gitlab](https://gitlab.com/sourcecheck), request permissions there if you are
curious about the project and can't wait that long!

For now, see our [architecture document](architecture.md)
