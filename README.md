# wms-ssi-prototype

Here is our preliminary, work-in-progress alpha release of our work for the
Grant for the Web. We are still hard at work at our private
[gitlab](https://gitlab.com/sourcecheck), so please forgive any rough edges and
do feel free to request permissions there if you are curious about the project
and can't wait for the first stable release!

For now, see our [architecture document](architecture.md).  The components are:
* [Publisher front-end](https://github.com/SourceCheckOrg/wms-ssi-ui/)
* [Publisher backend API](https://github.com/SourceCheckOrg/wms-ssi-api/)
* [Publisher backend dB](https://github.com/SourceCheckOrg/wms-ssi-db/)
* [Reader PDF-reader](https://github.com/SourceCheckOrg/wms-ssi-preview/)
